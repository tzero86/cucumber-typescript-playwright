    Scenario: As a user I can interact and asserts on text areas
        Given I am on the "home" page
        And I click the "playground" button
        When I am directed to the "playground" page
        And the "textarea" should contain the text "Testing Talks Hub has been established to teach the community how to build world class automation frameworks using the latest tooling."
        And I fill in the "textarea" input with "Learning to fly!"
        And the "textarea" should contain the value "Learning to fly!"
